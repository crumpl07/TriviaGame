# TriviaGame

The application we are aiming to build is a trivia game creator. The user will be able to create a trivia game where they and other users will be able to play the game after it has been created. In the creation section, users will be able to specify the trivia category, questions, correct answers, and incorrect answers. This data will be stored in a MySQL database.

Below are some screenshots of the project and its different scenes.
